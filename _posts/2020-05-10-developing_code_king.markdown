For my project, I decided to make a version control system called Code King. 

I want it to have some type of advantage over other version control systems. It is an important skill to know not only how to program good software, but also what the software should be like. Good software is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to get a lot of work done. My program, Code King, is an attempt to fullfill all three of these needs. It provides users with a user interface that displays a lot of useful information. The home page allows users to view all of the repos globally, all of the repos created by the current user, and all of the pushes create by the current user. It gives the user a quick look at all of the information that is needed to use the program.

I plan to add more and more features to this program. Although I doubt it will ever be as big as GitHub, you never know what can happen. However, this is more of a learning project than anything else. I do not expect anyone except myself or a couple other people to look at it. However, what many other people will see is the knoweldge and experience I gain from this project. After getting real-world practice developing software, I will be able to produce great software in my career.
