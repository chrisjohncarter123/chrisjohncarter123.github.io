Proverbs 3:13-15, NKJV

13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
And the man who gains understanding;

14 For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver,
And her gain than fine gold.

15 She is more precious than rubies,
And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her.

Computer programming is a very skill that requires great wisdom. I decided to build an application that helps give people wisdom they need to accomplish their tasks. This application, called "Wisdom Mine", uses web mining to scrape biblehub.com for bible chapters and bible commentaries. 

In my journey, I found ruby to be a great language. Over the past few years I have been programing, I have learned several languages, including C#, C++, and Java. I found that with Ruby, it is easy to write programs using simpler code than other languages. I also am thankful to have learned several things about software engineering while working on my project:

---First, I learned the importance of staying confident in my own abilities. I decided to use RubyMine as an IDE because it is very popular, and I wanted to learn a new IDE. Howver, as I was starting to learn how to use it, I became fearful because it seemed like a complicated program at first. During that time, I had fearful emotions, and instead of choosing to be confident, I let my feaful emotions lead me, and I did not get much done in about an hour of work. However, after I took a break, I realized I needed to make an inward adjustment. So I positioned myself to be confident, and beleive I will learn and grow. Then, learning became easy and it wasn't long before I understood new things and took advantage of the rubymine IDE.

---Seccond, I learned that there are so many uses and gems for Ruby! I used to colorize gem to add some color to the CLI. However, it seems like there is a never-ending supply of gems that I could have used. I decided to use the colorize gem simply because I read from several people that they enjoyed the gem, so I trusted them, and I am thankful I did because it was a very useful gem. I hope that one day, a programmer just like me will use one of the ruby gems that I program, and it will help them as much as colorize helped me!

---Third, I learned that I enjoy programming because of the freedom it gives me. Many times, there are many ways to solve a single problem, and I enjoy finding the solution to the best of my ability. I want to write code that has many good characteristics, including making it easy to understand, easy to expand, and reusable.

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog post, and I will see you next time!
