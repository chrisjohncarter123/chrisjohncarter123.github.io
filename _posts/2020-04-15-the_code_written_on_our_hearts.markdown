In a way, we are all computers with code written on our hearts.

However, this code is not in the form of if statements, binary, or ruby code. In fact, the code written on our hearts is what drives us to make our daily decisions.

For example, I may have the words "I like vanilla latte" written on my heart. At times, I will desire a vanilla latte, because of these words. All these words on our hearts can be reporgrammed to whatever we like. I think everybody has habbits they don't like, or "errors" running in their own hearts. I believe if we take the same principles we learn in software engineering, and use them to engineer out hearts and minds, we would all be walk closer to becomming the person we all wish to become.

I am enjoying my time here at Flatiron school. I have learned how to program my computer to make websites, crunch numbers, and use different technologies. I am also being trained in life skills, such as: always being responsible enough to drink enough coffee, how to always be searching the deeper things in my mind, and taking the time to have a realistic and hopeful perspective on life. 

Through all of these experiences, every small word that is written on my heart, adds up to who I am as a whole over a long period of time. Understanding this principle gives me a healthy fear to be able to stay away from things that may write "errors" on my heart, and stay close to the things that write good words on my heart.

Being sloppy with writng code, although it is easier and quicker in the moment, will add up to much larger problems in the future. For a large project, the code I write today is the foundation for the code I write tomorrow. Sand is not a good place to build a house on because it will quickly be destroyed if a large wave comes. In the same way, sloppy code is not a good place to build a project on because once a difficult problem arises, the whole project may fail.
