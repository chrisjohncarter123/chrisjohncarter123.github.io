Before I began my project, I took some time to think about developing an app that is important to me. I brainstormed several different ideas. I put myself in the shoes of a CEO of a large company, and I thought what type of software a large company would need. 

I didn't want to simply develop an app that would make the most money. I wanted to make an app that would be meaningful to myself and others, and something that would bring the most profit in happiness. It can be so easy for me to fall into the trap of devoting myself to things that are not deeply meaningful to my values, and instead only be interested in making money for myself.

When I first began my project, I was thinking about making an app that would simply help my career out the most. Now, after reflection and looking at myself, I thought about apps that I could build that are of interest to me. I thought about some things I am interested in, such as graphics, movies, or food. However, sometimes it feels like like several philosphers live in my mind and they must discuss everything until they come to the right conclusion. I decided to make an app that stores coffee descriptions. 

Coffee is deeply meaningful to me because it helps me wake up. It is a gift from higher beings that should be used with thankfulness and trust. I wish to share the gift of coffee to the whole world and this app is a step in the right direction.
