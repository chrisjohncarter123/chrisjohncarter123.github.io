A very common phrase used today is "Knowledge is Power". Software Engineering has great capacity to grow greats amounts of information very quickly. A good program is easy to use by most people, and can handle great amounts of data. I believe that when software engineering is used closely with other areas of computer science, such as data science and cyber security, the prosperity of the earth will rapidly increase for many years. I want to be a part of this great wave of improvement and change. Although software engineering is a very young type of engineering, it has made great changes to the planet in a short period of time. I would like to help increase the knowledge of software engineering on the planet in the ways I am able to. For me, it is exciting and logical to do my best to increase the progress of the planet. Who knows what is possible with the information that can come from good software? What will the planet look like in 100 years from now? Science fiction is quickly turning into science factual! With the rise of new technologies and companies such as Tesla that created cars ahead of its time, and Apple that revolutionized the world of phones, the next big breakthroughs and technologies are coming quickly, and I would like to be a part of the change.
