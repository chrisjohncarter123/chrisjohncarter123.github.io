The physicist will say that light is a frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum. The eye is profoundly amazing, able to go beyond what any other part of our bodies can experience. In the same way, the mind that understands is able to see things that are beyond the physical boundries of time and space. Light can be an understanding that reveals the truth in a complicated problem, like light can reveal the truth in a dark room.

Growing in understanding is like growing more pairs of eyes that can detect different parts of the world. Has there ever been something in your life that at one time did not have much meaning, but as you progessed in life, looking back you understood it did have importance? This is because life experiences changes the DNA of our understanding.

During my time learning programming languages, I gew a new pair of eyes able to see things I couldn't see before. From the importance of finding the right refactor, to fixing a bug, and even to solving a challenging algorithm, I have found there to be no end of the landscapes of computer programming to look upon. Who can find the "end of all knowledge"? Of knowledge, creativity, and inventing, there can never be an end. It is impossible for the momentum of humans to slow down to a stop, because the rate of knowledge being produced is increasing so rapidly.

Growing in understanding is one of the most precious good things we have the honor to receive. I wish to use my accumulated knowledge in truth and thankfulness, remembering the importance of other people always.
