Currently, I am studying for my Master's degree in Cybersecurity. The more I learn about cybersecurity and cybercrime, the more I understand the importance for highly trained security professionals. Many companies are having frequent breaches. The cost of a breach today is almost 4 million dollars [1]. This has motivated me to build sources of information for people looking to build the skills needed for a career in cybersecurity.

In response to this, I plan to build a website that gives users a 100% free curriculum on the basics of cybersecurity. I plan to take diligence to make the content to focus on using tools used by ethical hackers and security admins. It can be very complicated to learn all of the different tools, and I hope my website makes the learning process as simple as possible. I also would like to discuss and analyze different breaches that are attacking the networks of organizations and companies. It would be a nice goal to find statistics of recent breaches, and provide useful information to security teams of companies.

The more I learn about cybersecurity and software engineering, the more I understand the importance of cybersecurity. As important as cybersecurity is today, it will greatly increase in importance in the upcoming years. Cybersecurity professionals are like the police force of the internet. Without them, there would be crime without measure; people would walk in and out of banks and steal all the money they need with no problem. 

I am writing the application in React.js. I want to keep things simple, so there will be no back-end. I also plan to run ads on the site.
