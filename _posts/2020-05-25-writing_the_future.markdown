After giving much dilligence and study to computer programming, I have found it to be very similar to writing normal languages. For example, both in writing books and programs, there needs to be organization of information, a logical flow of ideas, and consistincy.

Programmers use doccumentation and stack overflow, but writers use dictionaries, thesaruses, and other books. üê∂

Both take great skill and thought to create good, solid work. A good author wants their writings to be used over and over again for many years to come. The information should be useful today, and in the future. It also needs to stay updated in case there are changes, for example, new discoveries in science or new political leaders. These are all similarities to writing good software.

I beleive if someone is a good programmer, that person will also be a good writer, and vice-versa. Writing is a very valuable skill for communication, critical thinking, and reccording. I am thankful for my time as a programmer, I am able to see clearer the similarites between these skills.
